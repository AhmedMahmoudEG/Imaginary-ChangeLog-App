# prodFlow App 🚀
A full-stack-ready backend application built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma ORM, designed to track and manage changelogs for digital products. Built with scalability and clean architecture in mind, this project supports multiple environments and is ready for cloud deployment.

---

## 📌 Overview

**ProdFlow** is a backend system for managing product changelogs. It allows developers and product teams to log, organize, and manage updates and features released over time.

This project now includes route handling, environment-based configuration, authentication, and unit testing — making it suitable for production environments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Node.js](w)
- [Express](w)
- [TypeScript](w)
- [Prisma ORM](w)
- [PostgreSQL](w) (via Docker locally or [Render](w) cloud-hosted instance)
- [Jest](w) (for unit testing)
- [Dotenv](w) (for environment configuration)

## 📦 Database Models (via Prisma)

- `User`: Represents a system user  
- `Product`: Represents a product being tracked  
- `Update`: Represents an update made to a product  
- `UpdatePoint`: Represents individual change points under an update  

More models and relations can be extended as the project scales.
